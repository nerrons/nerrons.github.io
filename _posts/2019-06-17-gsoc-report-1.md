I am very grateful that I my proposal got selected by Purr Data. From my perspective, I put a lot of
efforts into researching the project idea and the code base, as well as communicating with the
maintainers of the project, and finally produced a promising proposal that is concrete and should be easy
to follow. However, I must admit that I wasn't really doing a good job in Phase 1. Due to personal
matters, I couldn't focus on getting the job done, postponed the work frequently and didn't have much
discussion with my mentor. Now, even though the K12 Mode is roughly working as planned, the quality isn't
as good as I've expected. I apologize for the lack of quality in my work.

That being said, I still have about two weeks to catch up, and I do want to continue working under Purr
Data and GSoC. Here, I will give a brief summary on the progress I've made until now and the next steps
before the first evaluation.
